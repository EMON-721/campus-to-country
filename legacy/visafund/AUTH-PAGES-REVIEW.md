# VisaFund Login & Sign Up review — 2026-10-10

Current project only, starting from saved version16 / commit9164bc52acb9d5d35a69c0264195b156c8697337. Previous ZIP files were not used. No production deployment, access-policy change, environment activation or database migration was performed.

## Implemented in this source update

- /login: Welcome Back to VisaFund, email/password, visibility toggle, Remember Me, Forgot Password and Sign Up link. Shared login for USER and SUPER_ADMIN; existing server database-role/status verification and mandatory TOTP gate preserved.
- /register: Create Your VisaFund Account, name/email/password/confirmation/country/currency, explicit English/Bangla preferred-language selector, visible strength meter, 12-character upper/lower/digit validation, terms/privacy consent, loading and result feedback. Signup calls the real existing Supabase server SDK; no dummy credentials or localStorage authorization.
- Navy/mint centered responsive card, existing VisaFund SVG logo, quiet background, linked labels and keyboard focus styles. Authentication CSS is scoped; existing financial pages were not redesigned.
- Both forms now remain visible when the provider is unconfigured, with a clear configuration notice and disabled password collection/submission. Legacy verified ChatGPT workspace entry remains available. This is not a claim that live email/password registration works without configuration.
- Public authentication navigation: logged out Login | Sign Up; USER Dashboard | My Account | Logout; server-verified SUPER_ADMIN Admin Dashboard | Account | Logout. Workspace/demo and admin header links updated accordingly. No separate Admin Login page/button; the retired URL still redirects safely.
- Logout invalidates current app provider session, clears auth cookies/state by full navigation, and returns through the hosting native signout endpoint to /login. Existing records are not deleted. No global logout feature added.
- Existing financial engine, country configuration, records, Demo Mode and dashboards preserved. No new migration is needed for this UI update; pending additive0006 from version16 remains required before activating its DB-role/session implementation.

## Executed tests

| Suite | Checks passed |
|---|---:|
| Financial engine | 21 |
| Auth policy | 24 |
| Admin services | 56 |
| Compiled financial/auth UI/API + local D1/R2 | 367 |
| Supabase SDK mocked-provider contract | 91 |
| Compiled Demo/FX/privacy | 189 |
| Total assertions/checks | 748 |

Final executed failures: 0. TypeScript noEmit, production Worker build and whitespace checks passed. API tests include visible Login/Sign Up fields, disabled-provider notice, header role links, USER role assignment, invalid credentials, USER/admin redirects with fresh MFA, suspended and banned restrictions, repeated login/logout, captured-session replay denial, recovery one-use grant, cross-user finance/document denial and synthetic historical ownership/balance preservation. Demo route rendering and isolation also passed. These are not748 independent browser test cases.

Not executed: real provider signup, duplicate-email actual provider behavior, delivered verification/recovery mail, real authenticator MFA, browser clicks/password-toggle interaction, desktop/mobile visuals, cookie refresh/Back/Forward behavior and live hosting-provider compatibility. The provider is missing, and the supported browser-control skill is unavailable. Mocked FX outage logs are intentional test fixtures.

## Exact remaining secure configuration

1. Create/connect a Supabase Auth project in its secure dashboard. No connected project or hosting authentication environment entries were present when checked for this update.
2. Enable Email/password and mandatory Confirm email, asymmetric signing, provider rate limits/refresh protection and TOTP MFA. Configure verified SMTP sender and email delivery. Use disposable USER A/B accounts for real staging tests.
3. Enter only through secure hosting settings: SUPABASE_URL (exact HTTPS project origin), SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (sb_publishable_ key), APP_ORIGIN (exact staging HTTPS origin), AUTH_PROVIDER_ENABLED=true only after its reviewed migrations/settings exist. Never place a provider secret/service-role key in the ordinary application Worker. .env.example has no secrets.
4. Set the provider Site URL and exact callback allowlist for the tested origin: /auth/callback, /auth/callback?flow=recovery, /auth/confirm and /auth/reset-password. Confirm-signup template must use /auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=signup. Recovery template must use /auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=recovery. No wildcard or merely untrusted flow query can authorize reset.
5. For operator@example.invalid, configure a NEW password privately in the provider interface and verify ownership. No admin account has been created here. Register/enroll as USER first; explicitly link the original ChatGPT workspace through both authenticated identities if required. A trusted operator then runs scripts/provision-admin.mjs using secret-manager-supplied provider secret/immutable ADMIN_SUBJECT/expected email, reviews the resulting SQL and applies the role grant using authenticated D1 operator tooling. Email alone never promotes anyone. Then sign in at /login, enroll an authenticator and verify a real TOTP before /admin/dashboard.
6. Follow AUTH-INTEGRATION.md for full identity preservation, provider/session caveats, backup/restore and rollback instructions. Production migrations remain unapplied. Verified backups, browser/staging tests and owner approval remain launch gates.

## Preview and readiness

Saved source review only. Current website https://visafund-emon.operator5081.chatgpt.site remains its prior private live deployment; it does not show these saved changes. Sites returned no current preview URL. Supported managed preview is internal QA only and cannot be started without the unavailable browser skill. No new website or improvised public preview was created.

The available source-review method is this checkout/report or the saved source version. To obtain a real functional private preview, the operator must provide an independently isolated staging environment with private access, D1/R2 bindings, HTTPS origin and securely configured provider; then apply pending additive migrations and run the same test suites plus real browser tests. This session cannot honestly provide a working preview link or claim complete live authentication. Await required secure configuration; no final deployment.

Infrastructure operators retain privileged underlying D1/R2 access; app admins cannot browse another user's finance. Logout tombstones cover current provider sessions; native dispatcher logout and browser cache behavior still need real verification. Password reset requests provider global signout but other-device access JWTs may remain valid until expiry. Existing admin public-content publishing integration and infrastructure backup/dependency-review limitations from PREDEPLOYMENT-REVIEW.md remain outside this focused pages update.

## Actual implementation and verification

| Component | Implementation | Testing | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| User Registration | Real Supabase SDK signup, strong password/confirmation/terms validation, confirmation-required, strict USER insertion | Synthetic SDK signup and policy tests passed; actual delivery/provider absent | Blocked live |
| User Login | Shared /login, server credential validation, status and database role lookup, USER redirect | Signed synthetic provider tokens, invalid credentials, repeat login, remember cookies passed | Blocked live |
| Admin Login | Same /login, database-provisioned role, MFA step before separate dashboard; old URL redirects | USER rejection and pre/post-MFA redirects passed | Blocked live provisioning |
| Admin MFA | Provider TOTP enrollment/challenge, verified signed aal2, five-minute freshness | Mock challenge and policy checks passed; no real authenticator | Blocked live |
| User Dashboard | Existing financial pages preserved, own identity only, visible Logout | Rendered routes, D1 owner queries and reports passed | Pass server; browser blocked |
| Admin Dashboard | Basic membership moderation, totals, deletion retention, metadata content, analytics, audit/security | Metadata leakage, moderation and deletion tests passed | Partial: public publishing integration remains incomplete |
| User Logout | Current provider session tombstone, local provider signout, cookie clearing, native top-level logout | Captured old session replay denied; repeated login/logout passed | Pass contract; browser/native dispatch blocked |
| Admin Logout | Visible dashboard logout, same current-session invalidation | Admin API denied after logout; MFA flow passed | Pass contract; browser blocked |
| Privacy Protection | Owner-bound D1 and private R2, admin APIs expose no other-user finance | Cross-user CRUD/download/report denial and private-marker absence passed | Pass tested server scenarios |
| Financial Calculations | Existing engine preserved | Opening/closing, cash flow, monthly/daily ledger, paired transfers and reports passed | Pass |
| Demo Mode | Existing isolated simulated practice state preserved | 17 sections rendered; mutation/reset/ledger/production isolation passed | Pass tests; interactive browser blocked |
| Currency Converter | Existing real-provider adapter/cache/date/stale handling preserved | Controlled mock rates, timestamps, conversion/outage behavior passed | Pass contract; current real upstream retrieval unverified |
| Navigation | Login/Register, unified admin redirect, protected login redirect; no Education Budget/Thailand reintroduced | Compiled route responses and labels passed | Pass server; clicks/Back/Forward blocked |
| Mobile Compatibility | Existing responsive layout retained | No supported browser-control skill available | Blocked |
| Database Backup | Exact operator export, object snapshot, restore and rollback plan documented | No production export/restore capability exercised | Blocked |

## Executed final suites

These are **assertions/checks**, not 1,031 independent browser test cases. All data was controlled synthetic data in isolated local databases/buckets.

| Suite / command | Passed |
|---|---:|
| node --experimental-strip-types tests-finance.ts | 21 |
| node --experimental-strip-types tests-view-model.ts | 10 |
| node --experimental-strip-types tests-admin.ts | 56 |
| node --experimental-strip-types tests-auth.ts | 24 |
| node --experimental-strip-types tests-v23.ts | 202 |
| node --experimental-strip-types tests-demo-practice.ts | 104 |
| node tests-api.mjs | 335 |
| node tests-v23-api.mjs | 189 |
| node tests-auth-api.mjs | 90 |
| **Final total** | **1031** |

Final failures: **0** in the executed suites. Initial development found two TypeScript errors (unknown JSON type and timestamp before declaration), fixed before checks passed. An invalid-login mock matcher did not match in the test harness; replaced with an ordered one-use invalid-credential response and reran successfully. Expected mocked FX outages log provider-unavailable messages and pass fallback assertions.

Blocked scenarios are not included in that executed count: real User A/B/Admin provider accounts and MFA, signup/duplicate-email actual provider behavior, verification/recovery email delivery, live cookie/session expiry/refresh and dispatch logout, interactive desktop/mobile/BFCache navigation, actual fresh upstream FX retrieval, production backup/restore, isolated staging preview, infrastructure encryption/dependency/security operations. There is no honest numerical count of unexecuted test cases because these are scenario groups, not an instantiated browser suite.

TypeScript noEmit, production build and whitespace check passed. Browser/Playwright was not run: the supported Sites browser skill is absent; no substitute preview server/browser was installed.

## Bugs/security changes

- Replaced server environment admin-ID allowlist with trusted D1 platform_roles. New accounts are USER; public role input rejected. Role CHECK prevents unsupported values. Missing role means USER, never admin.
- Active membership required alongside SUPER_ADMIN; protected users cannot be moderated/deleted through normal admin operations.
- Logout now works at the app API boundary even with provider disabled, clears cookies and invalidates the current provider session_id. Captured provider tokens cannot continue VisaFund access after logout.
- Added signed-out fallback marker and verified native return route; no unverified browser identity override.
- Added protected page lifecycle/session checks for browser cache recovery. Actual Back-button behavior still needs browser verification.
- Login distinguishes invalid credentials, email confirmation and restricted-account responses. Login, logout and successful MFA audit events contain no passwords/tokens/private banking values.
- Verification callbacks route administrators back through the same MFA gate. MFA availability metadata reflects configuration.
- Added visible dashboard logout and restored requested public Login/Register links. No separate Admin Login page.

## Preservation and migrations

Additive **drizzle/0006_robust_wallflower.sql** creates platform_roles/auth_revoked_sessions and USER-backfills existing membership IDs. Existing financial values/ownership were seeded before migration and checked unchanged after applying all migrations locally. Unsupported roles were rejected. Production database was inspected at schema level only and was not migrated. Drizzle journal/snapshot are included; the SQL role CHECK is manually maintained in the migration.

Current source architecture: Vinext/React/Cloudflare Worker, D1 SQLite, private R2, Supabase SSR Auth adapter, legacy dispatch-verified ChatGPT identity and unique auth_identities mappings. Authentication does not replace the financial database. /auth/link requires both identities and recent provider password; financial owner IDs are preserved.

## Remaining critical setup and security findings

1. No connected Supabase project and no hosting auth environment values were found. Configure email confirmation, SMTP, exact callbacks/token-hash templates, publishable key, origin, provider rate limits and TOTP. Follow AUTH-INTEGRATION.md. Keep provider disabled until isolated staging tests pass.
2. **operator@example.invalid is not yet provisioned as admin.** Set a NEW password in the provider secure interface. Verify the immutable provider UUID and original ownership, explicitly link if required, then use scripts/provision-admin.mjs with an operator-only secret manager session and review/execute the resulting D1 SQL. No password is requested in chat or included in examples.
3. Normal logout invalidates this session only. Password reset requests global provider refresh-session signout, but old access JWTs from other devices can remain valid until provider expiry. No separate global logout UI was added. Tombstones have no cleanup yet. Native ChatGPT revocation relies on the hosting dispatcher.
4. D1/R2 infrastructure/service operators retain privileged access; the app admin dashboard does not. At-rest encryption and backup controls are infrastructure responsibilities, not independently verified here. No end-to-end encryption or PostgreSQL RLS claim.
5. Admin country/requirement/source/content panels store platform metadata; publishing those values into the current public rule/destination configuration is incomplete. Existing official configuration was preserved. Do not consider all platform-management modules finished.
6. Deletion requires explicit approved retention variables. Provider-identity deletion and other-user provider revocation are not implemented privileged operations. App status blocks access immediately; owner-scoped D1/R2 deletion is tested after retention.
7. Verified D1/R2 backup and restore are required before migrations/deployment. Source rollback is not a database restore. See the secure operator runbook in AUTH-INTEGRATION.md.
8. HTTPS URLs and secure cookies/CSRF/origin guards/security headers/bounded validation/parameterized queries/owner checks were inspected and tested where suites cover them. This is not an independent penetration test or completed infrastructure/dependency vulnerability audit. Remaining dependency review is a launch gate.

## Preview and approval

Only save the prepared source version. Do not deploy it, alter audience or activate incomplete auth. Current link is the existing private live site, **not** a preview of these changes. There is no independently isolated staging URL supported/provisioned in this session. Available method: provision a separate private staging runtime with isolated D1/R2 and secure Supabase test configuration, apply the additive migrations there, then run the documented suites and supported browser QA. A saved version alone is source review, not a working preview.

The source archive contains the complete current code, migrations, placeholders and runbooks. No credentials or production financial data are included. Await real staging validation and owner deployment approval.

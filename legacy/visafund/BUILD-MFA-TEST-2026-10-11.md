# VisaFund build and authentication verification — 2026-10-11

Application source tested: `0ea807b39382ca78a05cd1d4250e90b2a455af75`, branch `cloudflare-preparation`.

## Executed and passed
- `npm run build:cloudflare`: complete production RSC, client and SSR build, exit 0. Framework dynamic-import bundling warnings are non-fatal.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: exit 0 after downloading the complete required project configuration and correcting optional-property checks in new test assertions.
- `npm run test:auth-cloudflare`: 123 checks against a synthetic Supabase provider and isolated Miniflare D1. Includes forged identity rejection, role enforcement, MFA-gated admin access, invalid credentials, session/logout revocation, suspended/banned accounts, recovery contract, admin privacy, module disabling/re-enabling and health diagnostics. This does not prove real email delivery or live MFA.
- `node --import tsx tests-auth.ts`: 29 synthetic policy/D1 checks.
- `node --import tsx tests-admin.ts`: 67 isolated database/service checks, including private financial exclusion, moderation, retention/deletion safety, module persistence and missing-column diagnosis.
- `node --import tsx tests-private-storage.ts`: 23 mock-transport checks.
- `node tests/module-policy.mjs`: all 15 disable/re-enable cases, invalid configuration, six operation mappings and four health cases.
- `node tests/rule-selection.mjs`: nine current/withdrawn requirement checks.
- Real browser: anonymous `/admin/dashboard` shows Super Admin access required. Login offers Google and email/password. Google OAuth advanced through account identifier and password to Google security-code verification.

## Corrections made to the tests
Resolve Miniflare through Wrangler's package context instead of a hardcoded pnpm directory, supporting both npm and pnpm layouts. Use valid current country/page fixtures and add module and health regression coverage. Initial runner/fixture errors were resolved and the affected tests rerun.

## Incomplete live checks
Google security-code secure handoff was declined; no authenticated VisaFund session or successful live admin MFA was verified. Actual authenticator enrollment/challenge, authenticated admin UI operations, real verification/recovery email delivery, and real private file upload/download remain unverified by this run. Synthetic MFA checks must not be represented as a live pass.

No production financial records or authentication configuration were modified. This pass built locally; it did not deploy a new production worker.
